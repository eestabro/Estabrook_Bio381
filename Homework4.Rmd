# Homework 04
## Question 1
```
Find: \t+   
Replace: ,   
```

Explanation: Notepad finds areas with 1 or more tab space and replaces it with ','   

## Question 2
```
Find:(\w+), (\w+), (.*)   
Replace:\2 \1 \(\3\)  
```
Explanation: Finds and captures the first and second word, then will find and capture the rest of the line. Using the replace I can reorder the line and add () to the line.   

## Question 3

```
Find:.mp3   
Replace:.mp3\n   
```

Explanation:Finds '.mp3 ' and adds a line break after every time it finds that   

## Question 4
```
Find:(\d\d+) (.*)(.mp3)   
Replace:\2_\1\3   
```

Explanation:Finds and captures 1 digit and then more then 1 consecutive digit. Then finds and captures everything else. Then finds and captures .mp3. I was then able to reorder the captured sections.   

## Question 5
```
Find: (\w)\w+,(\w+),(.*),(\d+)   
Replace: \1_\2,\4   
```

Explanation: Finds and captures the first letter of the line, captures the second word, and captures the last number in the line. Then I was able to reorder the data set in the replace.   

## Question 6
```
Find:(\w)\w+,(\w{4}).*,(\d+)   
Replace:\1_\2,\3   
```

Explanation:Similar to Question 5, but I only captured the first 4 letters of the second word instead of the whole word.   

## Question 7
```
Find:(\w+),(\w{4})(\w+),(.*),(.*)    
Replace:\1, \5, \4   
```

Explanation: Similar to question 6, but I captured the whole first word, and captured the two numbers at the end seperately.
