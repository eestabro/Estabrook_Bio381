# Code Chunks
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

nGroup <- 3
nName <- c("Control","Treatment_Pre","Treatment_Post")
Control <- rnorm(n=6,mean=5.0,sd=2) # control and treatment_pre would in theory have the same (or similar average erosion rate
Treatment_Pre <- rnorm(n=3,mean=5.0,sd=2)
Treatment_Post <- rnorm(n=3,mean=2.0,sd=2) # treatment_post would have a low erosion rate since it is after mitigation is put in
nSize <- c(6,3,3)
```
```
My initial fake dataset had a range of P values with Five out of eight runs resulting in significant results. Some P values were quite high (0.539) which reduces my confidence in these results. 

The mean for Treatment_Post will be lower than Control or Treatment because in theory less erosion will occur at sites where erosion mitigation is placed. The effect size of control and treatment_pre can be the same and still have mostly significant results. The smallest effect size between control/treatment_pre and treatment_post is 3.0. 

My sample size is very small to begin with which lowers my confidence in results. This test is on the high range of surveys I will do at each site and I was still getting some insignificant P values on some runs. The current nSize variable is the smallest I would go. 
```
```{r}
ID <- 1:(sum(nSize))
Erosion_Rate <- c(Control,
            Treatment_Pre,
            Treatment_Post)
Treatment <- rep(nName, nSize)
ANOdata <- data.frame(ID,Treatment,Erosion_Rate)
str(ANOdata)

ANOmodel <- aov(Erosion_Rate~Treatment,data=ANOdata)
z <- summary(ANOmodel)
print(z)
```
```{r}
ANOPlot <- ggplot(data=ANOdata,aes(x=Treatment,y=Erosion_Rate,fill=Treatment))+
          geom_boxplot()
print(ANOPlot)
```
